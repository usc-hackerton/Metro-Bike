# How to contribute project by sequence
**Evaluation and Suggestion of Efficiency of Metro Bike Stations (Introduction Stage)**
- Visualization of the current bike stations (ratio : return+1 / total+2) expressed as efficient by heatmap and color points.

**Visualization and Suggestion based on the Bike Stations for Service (Development Stage)**
- Visualization of LA metro bike
  - Propose removal of places deemed inappropriate by figures and set up bike stations in traffic centers.
- Visualization of the rental status for each stations and a suggestion of a Bike Station to allow space

**Presentation of service based on visualization information (Service Stage)**
- Presentation of significant data visualization and recommendation of bike station location considering the bike station space.
