# How to contribute project by sequence
**Evaluation and Suggestion of Efficiency of Metro Bike Stations by Visualization of Data (Introduction Stage)**
- Visualization of the current bike stations (return / rent) expressed as efficient by heatmap and color points.

**Visualization and Suggestion based on the Bike Stations for Service (Development Stage)**
- Expression of visualization according to the 'share metro bike' data in LA opne data.
- Ranking(Plot) after determining the degree of rental of bicycle stations according to traffic volume
  - Propose removal of places deemed inappropriate by figures and set up bike stations in traffic centers.
- Visualization of the rental status for each stations by time zone and a suggestion of a Bike Station to allow space by using esri.

**Presentation of service based on visualization information of current bike system (Service Stage)**
- Presentation of significant data visualization and recommendation of bike station location considering the bike station space.
